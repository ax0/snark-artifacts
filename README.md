# proofcarryingdata/snark-artifacts

Repo for holding large binaries needed for ZK proofs, particularly for families
of GPCs (General Purpose Circuits).  These are kept out of the `zupass` monorepo
to avoid bloat.

Everything here is still experimental while the specific method of artifact
generation and distribution is being worked out.

TODO(POD-P3): Document how to find and use artifacts.
