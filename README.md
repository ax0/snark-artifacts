# proofcarryingdata/snark-artifacts

Repo for holding large binaries needed for ZK proofs, particularly for families
of GPCs (General Purpose Circuits).  These binaries are used by code in the
[Zupass](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass) repo, but stored in a
separate repo to avoid bloat.

This repo is still experimental.  See the `pre-release` branch for the
latest.
